# mdBookGitAutoBuild
A simple app for automatic [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) building from a git repository

Do you use mdBook ?  
Don't want to manually build and update files on a web host ?

This is a solution for that.

This app pulls a documentation git repository, rebuilds mdBook and host the files.

Read the [wiki/documentation](https://github.com/lukassoo/mdBookGitAutoBuild/wiki) for setup instructions and docker run commands
